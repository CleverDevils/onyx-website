- Line array speaker system with 120dB SPL capacity
- Intelligent lighting rig with 200+ fixtures
- 8-camera live switching for IMAG and streaming

### Breakout Sessions
- 12 rooms with independent AV systems
- Wireless presentation from any device
- Live streaming to virtual attendees
- Q&A integration with mobile app

### Live Streaming
- Multi-platform simulcast to 50,000+ remote viewers
- Real-time translation in 6 languages

## Technical Challenges

The venue's unique architecture required custom rigging solutions for the main stage LED wall. Our team completed the install in 36 hours while coordinating with venue staff and other vendors.

## Results

The event received record-breaking virtual attendance and a 95% satisfaction rating for AV quality. We've been retained for the next three years.
