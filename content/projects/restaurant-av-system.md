## Project Challenge

The restaurant needed an AV system that could adapt to different service periods - from intimate fine dining to energetic late-night bar service - while maintaining acoustic separation between zones.

## Our Solution

We designed a fully integrated system that provides:

### Distributed Audio
- 8 independent audio zones
- Ceiling-mounted speakers invisible to guests
- Subwoofers hidden in architectural elements
- Zone-specific volume and source control

### Lighting Control
- DMX-controlled LED fixtures throughout
- Pre-programmed scenes for different service periods
- Gradual transitions between breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late-night modes
- Color temperature adjustment to complement food presentation

### Private Dining
- Dedicated AV system for the private event room
- 85" display for presentations
- Wireless microphone system
- Isolated audio from main dining areas

## Staff Interface

Restaurant staff control the entire system via iPads at the host stand and bar. Simple interfaces allow quick scene changes while locking out advanced settings to prevent accidental changes.

## Impact

The owners report that guests frequently comment on the atmosphere, and the private dining room has become the most requested space for corporate events.
