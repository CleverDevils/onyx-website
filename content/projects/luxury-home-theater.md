## The Vision

The homeowners wanted a true cinema experience without leaving home. Working closely with their interior designer, we created a space that combines cutting-edge technology with luxurious comfort.

## Technical Specifications

### Video
- Sony 4K laser projector with 3,000 lumens brightness
- 150" acoustically transparent screen
- 4K HDR playback with Dolby Vision support

### Audio
- 9.4.6 Dolby Atmos speaker configuration
- Dual 18" subwoofers for deep, impactful bass
- Acoustic treatments for optimal sound quality

### Seating & Comfort
- 12 reclining theater seats with motorized adjustment
- Under-seat tactile transducers for immersive bass
- LED aisle lighting and starfield ceiling

## Automation

The entire room is controlled via a single touch panel or voice commands:
- One-touch "Movie Mode" dims lights, lowers shades, and powers on all equipment
- Integration with streaming services and physical media
- Climate control synchronized with occupancy

## The Result

This theater has become the heart of the home's entertainment. The clients host regular movie nights and have even screened films for local charity events.
